# Lab 9

This lab includes three programs getMostFreqChar.c, addressOfScalar.c, and addressOfArray.c/ In the first program the user is prompted to type out a string, the code then prints out he most frequent character in that string. The next program addressOfScalar.c prints out the address of a scalar, and the program addressOfArray.c prints out the address of an array. All three programs can be run on a text editor or command line. Also attached is a pdf explaing the process gone thorugh to write the code and example outputs.
